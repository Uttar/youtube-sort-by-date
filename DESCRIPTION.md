YouTube Sort by Date

Restore the missing "Sort by Date" functionality on YouTube!

YouTube recently removed the ability to sort search results by upload date in certain regions and views. This lightweight extension adds a "Sort by Date" button directly to the YouTube search filters, allowing you to instantly reorder videos from newest to oldest.

Key Features:
- Adds a "Sort by Date" button to the search filter menu.
- Works on search results, channel pages, and Home feed.
- Intelligent date parsing (supports "hours ago", "days ago", "weeks ago", etc.).
- Preserves page layout and non-video elements (like Shorts shelves or ads).
- Minimalist design that blends perfectly with the native YouTube UI.

How to use:
1. Perform a search on YouTube or visit a channel's video list.
2. Click the "Filters" button (if in search) or find the "Sort by Date" button in the menu area.
3. Click "Sort by Date" to reorder the current list of videos by their upload time.

Note: For best results, ensure your YouTube interface language is set to English.
